## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

- **Beneficiary** Mrisho Lukamba
  


Vane is a parachain that act as an extension product and safety layer for Polkadot and AssetHub which provides services to help trust and growth on social commerce business and introducing transaction safety in web3.


Vane-network consist of the following functionalities

 - Confirmation and reversible transactions
 - Customizable and trustless transactions for social-commerce business
 - Native token-less parachain enabling usage of DOT, USDT & USDT for all interactions via XCM
 - Extensible and hybrid chain, providing a permissioned smart contract feature which help tailored developers to build services for social-commerce eg, Notion template marketplace.


 - Vane-network will be a Tanssi appchain

 **Why are we building vane-network**

 - We are building vane-network due to lack of safety when using web3 services. Both of us have suffered loss of funds and from our survey users are afraid of trying web3 based services due to non recoverable losses associated with personal mistakes.

 But apart from that we discovered that social-commerce is a trillion dollar market and we believe that blockchain technology can improve and grow businesses in this sector by improving customer and retailer interactions and introducing negotiable control and unparalled safety.

**Vane as part of Polkadot/Substrate/Web3 ecosystem**
  - Can be used as a defacto system to handle safe and risk free transactions for institutions and indivuals 
  -  Can be used to enable social-commerce entrepreneurs to tap into polkadot ecosystem behind the scenes and grow their business, this will make Polkadot actually serve the need of a big market (social commerce market).

### Technologies used
  - Substrate
  - Rust
  - Next JS
  - TypeScript

*NOTE* vane-network is not building an sdk, it will be a fully fledged ready to use product

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

  - This project is a clear demonstration on how XCM can be used to introduce safety and improve UX in web3 ecosystem.

  - And XCM can be used to add a sort of extension layer ontop of existing network and introduce a product layer.

**Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**
   - Crypto users for transactions
   - Social commerce entrepreneurs

**What need(s) does your project meet?**
  - Introducing safety for web3 mass adoption
  - Bridging and using web3 based technology to grow online businesses.

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**
  
  - No, but ENS and Naing services try to solve the issue of ensuring wrong address mistakes are resolved. But Vane ensures this product to work just outside the box without purchasing any name, just existing address but introducing confirmation and reverting system on top of existing networks.

  - And for other product, No any other project.
  Vane will be using existing USDT on AssetHub to settle business social-commerce transactions.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2.9 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 5.15
- **Total Costs:** 20,000 USD

  ### Preamble
  The following pallets and components implementation are structured in a way that the prior implementation will be depended by the post implementation. And the first milestone is the improvemnet on how we implement the POC.
  The POC implemented most of things in customized existing pallets but they seemed too rigid and did not fit vane implementation vision, so that is why there is vane custom pallet asset. And other pallets are totally unique.

  Note that we removed our initial first milestone, we will implement that without any cost. We strongly believe after the funding of Vane from web3 foundation we will be rady to go the market and prove our case by action that users need safety in their day to day crypto interactions ( transactions ) and blockchain can be used in social-commerce.

  We have already deployed into Tanssi DanceBox testnet.


  ### Note:
  As per requirement of web3 grant deliverables is to submit an article. But as we do believe the purpose of the article is to communicate with users/community and we do think a video might communicate much better than an article, hence we will be providing a video containing a workshop, user experience usage and our experience in the web3 foundation grant. We do believe videos get better engagements and if we want to be heard, its better we do that.




### Milestone 1 â€” Trasanction Delivery Tracking System with XCM & Pallet Tansaction Claim.
 

- **Estimated duration:** 0.7 month
- **FTE:**  2.5
- **Costs:** 9,000 USD



| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Video tutorial | We will publish an workshop on X/Twitter that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant and how the product should be used) |
| 1. | Transaction Delivery Tracking System | As vane-risk free transfer system involves the following parts.<br> Relay_chain xcm reserveTransfer to Vane, confirmation of sender and receiver's address,sending xcm instructions to relay/assethub for transacting asset from vane para account to receiver.<br> The following are notable issues which may arrive; Failure to deliver and execute XCM message to vane, and relay/assethub.<br><br> A tracking functionality of where the transaction stuck is essential and will be implemented as a struct of an enum and stored in transaction tracking storage with key of multi_id.<br> The updating will be based on queries of effect of what the transaction is supposed to do using XCM.<br>|
| 2. | Pallet Transaction Claim             |This pallet will be used to resolve stuck transaction based on the delivery tracking data stored.<br>The resolving includes, claiming back the funds and finishing the transaction (sending to beneficiary).<br><br>Mechanism of resolving is handled on OnInitialize block hook. The claimer submits a structured struct claim with neccessary claims and intention. The resolving function will check the truth of the claim by asserting on the specific transaction desired outcome.<br> |
| 3. | Backend  (Nest JS)                   | All chain ( vane, polkadot/rococo, assethub) api interaction implementation, API chart workflow |
| 4. | FrontEnd (Next JS)                   |  A front end prototype in Figma, A front end interaction for implemented feature hosted in vercel which will be only for wide screen ( no responsiveness ) as later on (not this grant ) we will implement a mobile application |

## Future Plans


**How you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term.**

 - Reach out to solopreneurs and social-commerce business owners in X/Twitter and have them a free trial and web3 market access

 - Telegram and Discord existing ecosystem reach out. As this product introduces safety for everyone and. It is something people need.
 Existing Polkadot and USDT users can benefit alot.

**The team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.**

  - We intend to raise only initial funding as we believe the product will be self sufficient. As we will be tapping into existing Polkadot users hence sharing profits with Polkadot and we do not introduce any new token thus enabling better UX.

  - Integrating Meta and X/Twitter accounts into vane-client and enabling entrepreneuers to expand their businesses.

  - A simplistic approach and a mobile application for better security and UX

  - 70% of revenue will be in USDT/stablecoin and 30% in alt-coin index. The realized revenue from alt index will be directed into supporting teams that want to extend Vane products and Polkadot ecosystem teams for research on cross chain messaging and infrastructure.
